      <h2 className="about-heading">Hey! I'm Aden.</h2> 
      <p className="about-para">
        I have always enjoyed technology and computing. Ever since I was young, my brother and I would argue about who would get to spend more time on our family desktop - whether it was to browse the internet, play games, solve puzzles, or learn more about what a computer could do. 
        <br/><br/>
        As I got older I discovered Myspace. I would spend countless hours designing my webpage, changing the HTML and customising the CSS. I also loved sandbox games, because they gave me the creative freedom to build whatever I wanted and enjoy the end product.
        <br/><br/>
        Fast forward a bit... I studied dentistry at university and worked as a dentist for 3 years. Even after this time, I still felt I needed to pursue the passion I always had for tech in a more impactful way. 
        <br/><br/>
        So I decided to learn programming. 
        <br/><br/>
        I did courses on Codecademy, watched tutorials on Youtube, built my portfolio website, worked on small projects and coding problems, and loved every second of it.
        <br/><br/>
        After about a year of self-learning, I was ready to take the next step in my coding journey. I took the plunge and enrolled in the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive Course. I lived and breathed code for 3 months, learning the fundamentals of developing good quality software.
        <br/><br/>
        The creativity, problem solving and high attention to detail involved in dentistry tied in perfectly with coding, and for me it was a natural progression. So here I am transitioning my career into the wondrous world of tech.
        <br/><br/>
        I believe I am fun, hard-working and determined. I want to implement creative thinking to come up with innovative solutions. Feel free to get in touch.
